SpaceLink Rental Platform
========================

About:
------
SpaceLink is a full-featured MERN stack rental platform designed to connect property owners with renters. It supports a wide range of property types, advanced booking workflows, real-time notifications, and secure authentication. The platform is built for usability, security, and scalability, making it suitable for residential, commercial, land, parking, and event space rentals.

Main Functionalities:
---------------------
1. Property Listings:
   - Owners can add, edit, and manage properties with images, details, and rental types.
   - Properties are categorized (Residential, Commercial, Land, Parking, Event).
   - Users can search, filter, and view property details.

2. Booking System:
   - Users can book available properties for specific dates and rental types (hourly, monthly, yearly).
   - Custom calendar blocks already booked dates, allowing only available dates to be selected.
   - Owners receive booking requests and can approve, reject, or end bookings early.
   - Price is calculated automatically based on booking duration and type.

3. User & Owner Dashboards:
   - Users see their bookings, status (pending, approved, rejected, ended), and can view details.
   - Owners manage their properties and see all booking requests, with actions for each.

4. Notifications:
   - Real-time notifications for booking events (new booking, approval, rejection, end).
   - Notification bell in the navbar with unread count and sidebar for viewing notifications.

5. Authentication & Security:
   - JWT-based authentication for secure access.
   - Profile completion required before booking.
   - Passwords are hashed and stored securely.

6. Responsive UI:
   - Built with React, Bootstrap, and Vite for fast, modern, and mobile-friendly experience.
   - Protected routes for authenticated pages.

7. Backend API:
   - RESTful endpoints for properties, bookings, users, and notifications.
   - Input validation, error handling, and consistent response format.

8. Database:
   - MongoDB stores users, properties, bookings, and notifications.
   - Relationships: User <-> Properties, User <-> Bookings, Property <-> Bookings.

How It Works:
-------------
- Owners list properties and manage bookings.
- Renters search for properties, view details, and book available dates.
- Booking requests trigger notifications for owners.
- Owners approve/reject/end bookings, triggering notifications for users.
- All actions are tracked and visible in user/owner dashboards.
- Calendar ensures no double-booking and smooth date selection.

This platform is designed for reliability, security, and ease of use for both property owners and renters.
